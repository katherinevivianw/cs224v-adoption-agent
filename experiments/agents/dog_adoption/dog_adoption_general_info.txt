Our mission is not only to simplify the adoption journey, but also to promote the idea of adopt, dont shop, helping users find loving companions in shelters and ultimately giving more animals a chance for a happy, forever home.
A hypoallergenic dog is a dog breed that produces fewer allergens in its hair and sheds less, making them a better fit for people with allergies.
